# Cinco-Dias-De-Clima
A 5 Day Weather Webpage.

## Description
This repository contains my solution for the Module 6 Challenge - Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

In order for my work to show what I can do, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to retrieve weather data for cities. I had to register for an API key from openweathermpa.org, too.

Subsequently, I was able to say that the following user story met its Acceptance Criteria:

- AS A traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs:

- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Installation
N/A

Usage
My final version of the webpage mirrors the UT Challenge source file, acceptance criteria, rubric, and Sample gif when rendered on a browser.

I used Chrome's console (inspect) to ensure my edits, adjustments, changes, and tweaks rendered correctly.

## Credits
Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own JavaScript and HTML updates. I was able to ask him questions to clarify, and he prompted and challenged me to take breaks and allow my mind to process the solutions which were brewing.

When stuck (and I was stuck a lot), I referenced the following sites:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

https://stackoverflow.com/

https://www.taskade.com/

https://google.com/

https://bing.com/

I also used these code and other material for data requests and responses, data retrieval, styling, and other things:

https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/

I referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my webpage, html, and styles.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue, once I referenced all files properly and landed urls in the appropriate places.
